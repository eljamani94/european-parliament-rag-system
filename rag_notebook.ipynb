    "This notebook implements a RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) system to query European Parliament plenary session transcripts. The EP holds 12 plenary sessions annually in Strasbourg, each lasting 4 days, generating extensive transcripts. Rather than manually searching through hundreds of pages, this system enables semantic search and question-answering over the corpus.\n",
